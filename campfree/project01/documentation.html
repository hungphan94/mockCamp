UUser Story #1: I can see a main element with a corresponding id="main-doc", which contains the page's main content (technical documentation).
User Story #2: Within the #main-doc element, I can see several section elements, each with a class of main-section. There should be a minimum of 5.
User Story #3: The first element within each .main-section should be a header element which contains text that describes the topic of that section.
User Story #4: Each section element with the class of main-section should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each header contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "Javascript and Java" should have a corresponding id="Javascript_and_Java").
User Story #5: The .main-section elements should contain at least 10 p elements total (not each).
User Story #6: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 code elements total (not each).
User Story #7: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 li items total (not each).
User Story #8: I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="navbar".
User Story #9: The navbar element should contain one header element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation.
User Story #10: Additionally, the navbar should contain link (a) elements with the class of nav-link. There should be one for every element with the class main-section.
User Story #11: The header element in the navbar must come before any link (a) elements in the navbar.
User Story #12: Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world").
User Story #13: When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the main-doc element (e.g. If I click on a nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element that has that id and contains the corresponding header.
User Story #14: On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user.
User Story #15: My Technical Documentation page should use at least one media query. -->

                <p>The International English Language Testing System (IELTS) is the world’s most popular
                  English language proficiency test for higher education and global migration, with over 3 million
                  tests taken in the last year.</p>
                <p>IELTS is the most widely accepted English
                  language test that uses a one-on-one speaking test to assess your English communication skills.
                  This means that you are assessed by having a real-life conversation with a real person. This is
                  the most effective and natural way of testing your English conversation skills.</p>

                <p>In IELTS, there are four papers: Listening,
                  Reading, Writing and Speaking. There are two
                  different IELTS modules: Academic and General
                  Training. The Speaking and Listening tests are the same in both modules,
                  but the Reading and Writing tests are different.</p>

                           usually be common words. Both UK and US spellings are accepted. When you hear the name of a person,
                           place, company, etc., in the recording, it may be spelled out. </p>
